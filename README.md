## Few considerations
During development, I choose to work with vue 3 and bootstrap 4 for CSS. I had worked with bootstrap 4 before but I've never tried VUE 3. Because of that, I had a few headaches, mostly because of configurations.

The biggest and was this one: https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196

Even tho, I hope you guys like it, almost everything was done.

### Customize configuration
