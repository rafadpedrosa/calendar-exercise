## Few considerations
During development, I choose to work with vue 3 and bootstrap 4 for CSS. I had worked with bootstrap 4 before but I've never tried VUE 3. Because of that, I had a few headaches, mostly because of configurations.

The biggest and was this one: https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue/issues/5196

BS4 does NOT support VUE 3 100% and a few things might not work properly as I understood. Tried to use JEST to test the components but then another problem because of it. I fixed some and took a time trying to fix the others. I'm not sure if I will have time to do more things tomorrow because of my actual job. Even tho, I hope you guys like it, almost everything was done.


### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
